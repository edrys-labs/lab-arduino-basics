It consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which runs on your computer. You use this software to write and upload computer code to the physical board.\n**What is Physical Computing?**\nPhysical computing involves designing and building interactive physical systems through the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the world around them. With Arduino, you can read inputs – light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message – and turn it into an output – activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.\n",

      "config": "# Arduino Tutorial\n## Step 1: Your First Project - The Blinking LED\n\n**Objective**: To make an LED blink on and off every second.\n\n1. **Build the Circuit**:\n\n   - Plug your Arduino board into your breadboard.\n   - Connect an LED to pin 13 and a ground pin through a 220-ohm resistor (to protect the LED).\n\n2. **Program Your Arduino**:\n\n   - Open your Arduino IDE.\n   - Copy and paste the following code into the IDE:\n\n     ```cpp\n     void setup() {\n        pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set pin 13 as an OUTPUT\n     }\n\n     void loop() {\n       digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // Turn the LED on\n       delay(1000);              // Wait for a second\n       digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // Turn the LED off\n       delay(1000);              // Wait for a second\n     }\n     ```\n  \n   - Click on the \"Run Code\" button to send your code to the Arduino.\n\n3. **See the Magic**: Once uploaded, the LED on your breadboard should start blinking.\n\n## Step 2: Adding Serial Communication\n\n**Objective**: To control the LED blinking with a command from your computer.\n\n1. **Modify Your Code**:\n\n    - Add the following lines to enable serial communication:\n\n       ```cpp\n       void setup() {\n         pinMode(13, OUTPUT);\n         Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication at 9600 bps\n       }\n\n       void loop() {\n         if (Serial.available() > 0) {\n           int state = Serial.read() - '0'; // Read the incoming byte and subtract '0' to get the integer value\n           digitalWrite(13, state);\n           delay(1000);\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n2. **Test Your Setup**:\n\n    - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.\n    - Type `1` to turn the LED on and `0` to turn it off.\n\n## Step 3: Introducing and Fixing a Compile Error\n\n**Objective**: To learn how to troubleshoot and fix errors in your code.\n\n1. **Introduce an Error**:\n\n    - Change `Serial.begin(9600);` to `Serial.beggin(9600);` and try to upload it.\n\n2. **Identify and Fix the Error**:\n\n    - The Arduino IDE will show an error message indicating that `Serial.beggin` is not a member of 'Serial'.\n    - Correct it to `Serial.begin(9600);` and re-upload the code.\n\n### Wrap-Up\nCongratulations! You have successfully completed the Arduino blink tutorial, mastered basic serial communication, and learned to troubleshoot a programming error. Now, you're ready to explore more complex projects and dive deeper into the world of physical computing!",
